Why are people happy about this?? I want PF out of office but im not happy about this. I wish madam Dora a speed recovery
How sure are we that it's not a way of her getting the share of that donated money🤔? Anyway nanga Bowman yena talwele pantu ukupitana kulya. Wishing her a quick recovery 😪
She will be among the discharged on Monday ...what???? All that effort of matching the outfit and the mask.... quick recovery
This is the true meaning of the statement, "when the hunter becomes the hunted" Get well soon!!!!!
Atleast she isn't hiding and she is the first patient we know.
Dora is a front line staff...quick recovery Hon siliya
I wish her a very slow recovery ...if possible she must get well the day prime tv will be back on our TVs
And she brings de total number of patients to?????
There's more of her...fish them out and help them.
Naba Doc bonse
In as much as you hate someone, wishing that person death makes y'all the same🚶🚶
Such a bad example, how are we supposed to follow the preventive measures they're telling us 🙄🙄
it's ok she is human and being a front line staff the risk is higher and it has happened..peace be still she shall overcome it she needs our support.
The only person so far since it's started have head her name get well Dollar although Dollar is still high
And that big mask she uses didn't protect her? ?😮😮
She ll be fine. It's different in Zambia
Hope she will be among those patients that will be dancing in the next video from the isolation centre
Oh no this is not good. Politics aside this should not happen to anyone. Wishing her quick recovery. Its good she has come out in open. Corona does not choose. Let's show solidarity. We are one country and one people.
I hope it’s not just propaganda so that she can rest from tv and live updates she’s been all over
Bowman Lusambo should also isolate himself.😮😮
She is worthy to contract as long as is a human being. what is wrong she was created to the same God who created you, remember covid 19 has no VIPS Wishing her a quick recovery she is a front line staff, she will fine.
We speak healing in Jesus name
She isn’t perfect. None of us are.but I hope she recovers and doesn’t get too sick.
God is not a respector of persons...... Let's not mock each other my brothers and sisters cause tomorrow it maybe you or your close relative.so, mind your comments
Get well soonest you are the hard working woman u being there since the beginning of this we know you r a strong woman and all will be well
Its possible....we all know she is an essential worker
She's going for the dance Ku isolation guys...hope no VIP isolation wards afunika muchintuntu bwingi...monday she will be negative wait and see.....
Our covid doesn't kill it's special 😕
Just advice her to dance a lot she will be fine in no time.
Wishing her a quick recovery, she has at least been instrumental in the fight against Covid-19.
It’s a trap! Don’t fall for it, don’t even dare donate a single penny
This should all tell us that it's only God who is keeping us. You may follow up all preventive measures but would still get the virus.
If God says yes, no man can say no. Let us keep up in prayer.
Wishing you a quick recovery Madam Dora Siliya.
Politics
So nayeve she's going ku chilanga olo there's a special place for them
Don't worry she will be discharged on Monday....our corona kills no one.
That's Corona for you. She should be in quarantine forever.
So even dr chitalu is positive in short all those at the press briefing should be quarantined and tested for covid 19..
Maybe that's the reason covid update have been reduced to twice a week those in for front are positive.
It doesn't make sense after all we know she is going to recover
She is well Zed Covid 19 is not deadly we all saw what happens behind the isolation ward walls
So she has not been practicing what she preaches everyday?
She will be discharged soon corona yamuzambia is not deadly ,otherwise if she was in Italy or England ,she was supposed to be Ku ICU by now
Why are people laughing...I'll never understand these "christians"
How come they have told us that Dora Siliya is sick when they have never reviewed the identity of those who have died of covid 19 and the medical personnel who got sick of covid 19, they always to tell us that it's confidential ,how come it's not confidential with Dora Siliya. There is something fishy. Get well soon madam honorable if truely you are sick of Convid 19
Auu, with that clean mask?My God you are a living God,let all of them have diarrhoea of the nose, I'm so happy, anyone who wants to drink Black label this evening??
And an IPHONE from one of the DOCTORS has been stolen by one of the COVID19 patients,ZAMBIA IS GREAT.
Is she showing symptoms?
If not,let her self isolate as per presidential directive.We Don't have enough resources to quarantine people.
My Dora...I know you to be a strong woman...that is just an advanced flu...you will be okay...wishing you a quick recovery...nothing much to worry about
She will be fine. The Zambian or African COVID 19 is user friendly as we saw from those dacing queens in Quarantine ward.
Going to isolation centre with Chilufya kaili automatically he has it too. Will still see each other every day 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣on a serious note, wishing the two quick recovery
I think it's very brave of her to come out in the open unlike others who just hide.... Secondly, there's nothing wrong with her being positive, any human being can get it so Kaya what the fuss is all about.
Get well soon Madam Siliya, Will Say a prayer for you
Its difficult to tell if its true... These politicians lie about everything!
It is not very easy to feel sorry for Dora but may she get well soon Zambia is not the same without Dora I just love to hate her
All the patients who tested positive to covid 19 theirs names where Not published,so hw come Dora Siliya's covid 19 has bn made public??I smell something
Quick recovery to her. She was always encouraging us to stay safe, stay at home if we can, but she had to work. Hope she recovers soon.
Some people you can be so evil. Instead of sympathizing with her, you play jokes on her condition. It's a sin. Repent and receive Jesus Christ as your personal saviour.
Now I believe we have covid in Zambia thank u minister for the testimony
Mmmm, am looking at this at 2 different angles.....
1. She could be infected which I wish her a quick recovery
2. She could be using the statement so as to encourage people to report themselves to the health authorities whenever they feel CORONIOUS
Tetu beans utu boss?
Wishing her and every patient a quick recovery,is she in the same isolation centre as everyone?
The problem with this disease there is nothing like being evacuated to another country. Everyone must be treated locally. It's a timely reminder to those entrusted with developing the health sector to do their best.
This is what I meant when I earlier said points of entry were supposed to be closed immediately the first case of Covid19 was recorded in Africa. The top leadership didn't want to take it serious. The virus has started hunting them one by one, this virus is so deadly, spread like wildfire such that it doesn't choose who to attack be it a Minister or a lower class person from the compound..
Chabipa madam spokes lady.
If you can get sick ma'am as careful as you're, what do you expect will happen to our babies at school come 1st June?
And she was at the gym with that gym instructor who just did aerobics with hundreds of people😮😮😮
That's leadership there from her. You will pull through mama.

Why were these others hiding? Including that other one?
U are just playing us games naimwe nima story yamu moba aya
There's hope and light at the end of the tunnel..i pray she comes out stronger from this temporal setback. My thoughts and prayers are with the hon and her family during this difficult time... I can only wish her well and a speedy recovery..
That's why I found 10 missed calls from uncle mulyokela's phone.. ummmmm auntie sure
Its not about a face masks all we need is Gods intervention, wish her a quick recover
I like her confidence for sending her video on social media and encouraging people to follow the healthy tips concerning covid 19. May our Lord Jesus heal her, Amen
Quick recovery, but whoever is behind prime TV closure please we are on your knees, Open that local company for the sake of numerous citizens benefiting from it!!!
Some comments live so much to be desired, shame, Zambians very quick at wishing Boris Johnson and Adris Alba a quick recovery when they had Covid 19. Lelo your own Minister of Information has Covid 19 rejoycing, awe bane let's practice what we preach. Otherwise shame on us.
we know her atemwa uko calila its because of the trending clip she watched where those covid19 victims were dancing...
So Dora is the reason the president said people who have tested positive for covid 19 but not showing any symptoms should be released and go home because they didn't want to put her in the isolation facilities😂😂
She's a Frontline Minister and very instrumental in this pandemic she can get it....wish her well and may GOD heal her and everyone else🙏🙏🙏♥️
What about our hard working Doc chitalu chilufye it has been long since I saw him let hope is not among the dancer's.
They have start adding themselves now..
Wish our mother a quick recovery.... She will be discharged on Monday, if it was in Italy I was going to be worried...
I really fail to understand the dullness of some people.is this really a fun thing to joke about when someone can even joke about death?let's stand as humans and confess like one.wish the Hon a quick recovery together with everyone infected and affected
I need to talk to her mask designer, those masks are just mmmmmmmm heniway, fyamu weldi, worry not mayo, our Covid doesn't kill, mwalapola, abanenu ku Chinsali chalila
I personally find it so wierd and strange for a true Zambian to make fun of a fellow human being who has contracted a deadly disease, it is not our culture it is in fact ungodly, no matter how much you hate someone. Really you are wishing someone dead, clear attributes of Satanism, may the Lord touch your hearts!
Oh so hers is a special case? She allowed MoH to disclose it to the general public? What happened to privacy and ethics? Kwena this country is a huge joke.
She will be fine,our Covid 19 is very friendly, the good part is it's not killing but there are just recoveries. She will recover too.
I don't believe her unless she die it's when I gonna believe,they want more donation.
Hope she shows us some dance moves in the isolation ward. People play drums another dancer has come.
since they say there are keeping names in secret y havnt they kept her name in secret like the other.. stop playing on our minds..let them oso start mentioning other people names we know them and send our sympathies to them..bt this is a nono starter..Ne HIV efyo chileba kaili. Alot of people would not have died of this disease as well.
Despite her flaws, I salute her bravery. Hope her family, friends and workmates will go through screening. Get well soon!!!
And where is the confidentiality of patients dat you always thrive to protect.
First which corona virus? Yaku Italy na USA or yamu Zambia? If it's Zambian corona virus then don't worry she will be fine
It's easy for people to talk about her because y'all not in her shoes this disease is a dead or alive thing only God can protect each one of us no1 plans to be sick of this covid-19 so the best thing is just to pray for all those infected including her for quick recovery everyone is at risk here it's not even something to joke about anyone can contract it it's not even choosing. Stay Safe
Dear Dora i love you so much in the sense that you ve been my source of inspiration and motivation. You are my role model from presenting news to minister plus other titles. Please get well soon and will be praying for you.
I just like how she has been open about it unlike keeping it a secret. This helps reduce the stigma around COVID-19. She has been very instrumental in this fight and has earned my respect. I honestly wish her well and pray she comes back with full force until the last patient is discharged. #stay safe
Maybe that's why it was said that "non symptomatic patients will no longer be quarantined in covid centers". Kanshi adada foresaw this coming
Wishing my honorable a quick recovery. She has been working tireless to combat the disease. Mama get well soon
That’s fake if she tested positive why did they allow her to go into self quarantine why dint they take her to the center where they are taking everyone, we know the plan
I have never hand sanitized I hardly put on a face mask I don't even practice social distance en I have never tested yet am fine to God be the glory
Thts a clear sign to tell us All tht it's only the maker who can protect us not all these precaution tht we re subjected to n it all depends on hw much u knw God get wEl soon n commit yoself in Gods hands he will do wonders
So sad. Wish her a quick recovery so that she gives experience based advocacy on control measures. She has been very active.
This makes sad reading,but she'll be fine. Can we try the newly found Zambian co cation on her so that we see if it really works? Wish her a quick recovery
Does it mean these preventive measures are not followed nabali kusogolo. That's why I always say its only GOD who can protect us 100%
Dora you are a great heroine. God is with you. You shall concur COVID19 in the Name of Jesus Christ. The Blood of Jesus is your covering. Be rest assured that that Zambians are praying for you because you are a national leader. I salute you with my entire family for your baldness and leadership to open up and disclose you have tested positive. God bless you Honorable Minister we are proud of you!
As prime TV director, I wish her a very slow recovery.
Though we have changeable moods and dispositions and tempers My Lord is not subject to these infirmities, but is invariable in perfect wisdom, love and power.
But she is always on a 😷 Mask,are these Masks really protecting us🤔olo tizivuta chabe
Wishing her a quick recovery. There is really no perfect way to prevent it. We need just do our best to keep safe.
Zambian covid-19 is witcheable, only recently she came out strong against pf brutality today tests positive mmmmmmmhhhhh mu zambia don't kill my crush ooooo🏃🏃
She is already healed than u are thinking .she is brave and only one has shared her illness the rest they are always fine
We pray for your quick recovery gallant daughter of our great Nation Zambia you have done us great pride through the spirited fight against Covid 19 that you put up
This is the first CoVID19 Confirmed case in Zambia 🇿🇲 so far. The rest were jx strategies to receive Donations.

And that big Mask she has been using now what.🙆
Anyway get well soon my lady
Good evening our lockdown is over now where to start the program we Thank God we are going back to the street.
At last we know a known corona patient in Zambia
She is fine already what is with these get well soon wishes? Its the same with someone testing HIV positive, do they have AIDS?
After watching the video,I doubt if she is truly positive.she said, she alerted the ministry of health.who tested you honourable?? you forgot to mention wen your samples were taken.. wishing you well.
There is no longer any cause for panic in a scenario of Zambian corona, who dies? Madam DORA that's just a high fever you're coming out of it just like you recovered in the past with malaria and flue!
She forgot to iron her mask both sides
Despite taking all the preventive measures she still tested positive... This Zambian COVID is really unique...we wish are well...
its a sad development to all of us,especially that we needed her most in this time of covid 19,we keeps praying for her so that she can recover in shortest time
if indeed Dora tested positive. For once am impressed because what she did is an act of leadership and leading from the front. We saw how big wigs that were in quarantine their names were kept as a secret but for her she has come out in the open and sent a message to the masses that Corona is real and people need to adhere to the MHO protocols on prevention
I wish her a speedy recovery. This shows that this disease doesn't discriminate, so we all gotta be cautious & adhere to all the measures prescribed to protect ourselves & everyone around us from contracting this virus.
I fear a total lockdown coz now it has reached Zambia...all along it was in Lusaka ,nakonda n copperbelt..but manje yafika ku zambia..
Why publicize her name if it's unearthical in health? Wishing her a quick recovery.
Next it's bow boy . And she attended cabinet meeting on Monday and went on to have a press briefing with Mr Mabumba .... As if that was not enough Mr chair she even attended the presidential address. Let's quarantine all her contacts.
Get well Dora baby❣️! we applaud your efforts, huge sacrifice, you have really been a champion towards the fight covid-19👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
We are praying for you madam Dora and all people around the world who have tested positive receive your healing in Jesus name
Madam come to my place, I will vundikila you in a blanket with boiled leaves for an hour by 2moro you be fine.
After all the masking, hand washing sanitizing, awe sure corona washupa,let's sanitize using anointed water or oil maybe that where healing is
It's Normal "i mean New Normal" she will be fine.
At least keep mentioning each and everyone's names who ever is tested positive with covid 19......so that we know maybe I can come across with my friend being tested+ so that i ask how it feels when you are +......I wish had Dora's #
Ati I don't have symptoms but I tested positive, kkkkk ba Siliya if truly u had it you weren't even going to announce like you did nefimaka nafi confidence, wake up & stop dreaming
Uku temwa ama allowance even when not necessary busy moving around just for allwances....
Any way wish u well... Advice ur friends to stop moving
We wish her a quickly recovery. At least she has come in open to inform us than other ministers who doesn't want to be heard.
Is she also dancing like the others
When is lusambo testing postive...too bad to my favorite TV presenter Dora siliya when encouraging people to obey safety rules.Get well soon .
Among all the corona patients in zambia, she z the only name we've heard so far.
There is too much drama in our country anyway get well soon!
Minister will be fine. We cannot spend an hour discussing her COVID status. Remember her in prayer & get back to the gold issue.🙏
she will be fine coz our covid its so special and unique it doesn't kill so worry not
But you people how can we forget that she is also a human being.... Same % of oxygen kuti afilwashani ukulwala ena..may the Lord be with her 🙏🙏
so nish she has not been masking up and washing hands nagu shani🙄l this masking thing does not work its just God apa
Too bad, wishing her a quick recovery, no 1 has immunity to covid that's the more reason we shud all take care & leave thoz jokes aside.
That makes her a true frontline worker. I have advised before that you should hold those updates outdoors and fumigate that room regularly. Now all journalists, donors and officials who attend are contacts. Self quarantine please and get well.
It's good that heaven and earth are equally affected by coronavirus. Let them also minimise movement.
Zambia is full of political comedians. How does the person who test positive for covid 19 become their own announcer instead of Ministry of Health? Let other coronavirus patients come out and announce. Otherwise, it's a political game, trying to shield some criminals who are under ACC investigations and about to be locked up. Anyway, wishing you quick recovery.
So for her u decide to announce and not withhold patients info. Did she volunteer as tribute?#hungergames
At first there was we can't disclose names of those who are positive, now it's New normal i see🤷🤔🤔.....
Avoid unnecessary movements madam you are the one spreading the disease because you don't practice what you say, same day you are in mandevu, chaisa and emmasdale compounds etc. Quick recovery dora.#stayhome# stay safe.
This is just cheap propaganda trying to force people to believe Corona is there.......we know it's not there, and all these are cheap tricks trying to make it look real and serious........no sense.
Mama dora we shall pray for u hon.And everyone inside we pray quick recovery children of God.God is able....
It is so sad to live life like a prisoner but due to other circumstances we have to adapt to the conditions. We have to respect ourselves and keep social distance as a precaution.
Get well soon our #essential Honourable. So far, our Covid has proven to being #friendly and #merciful unless otherwise!!
Hmm ba Dora why anyway she will recover because she is a strong woman who has been with us in this trying moment firmly and positive minded in winning corona fight.yika shupa let me know as am in madagascar
And how is her case special? Does it mean more money in the country if yes then more money in their pockets
Sad development you have been relentlessly day in , day out risking your life giving the nation updates and ensuring the were doing the right thing to prevent themselves from covid,
We appreciate all your selfless efforts and energies directed towards this fight and we can rest assure you that your message and information did not fall on deaf ears and that we learnt a lot from you. Your infection with this virus was not in vein but for the good of your country you love and cherish.
Note that you were not alone during those educative pronouncements you made about covid 19, and so went we leave you alone during this time of sickness. We are with you in spirit and prayers for speedy and steady recovery.
Long live Madam Dora
Wonderful, accept that names were supposed to be in order according to seniority in terms of birth.
Meaning Dr Chitalu chilufya is also positive without knowing teh kaili they are always together...
Corona ni corona wetha u put on a masks ,sanitize your hands n wash your hands pafupi pafupi yikafika nishi yafika.God we thank u us bamuma komboni pantu only 40 % of the pipo follow the measures .lesa mukulu zoona chachine ....
Mmmm too bad, that woman is one of the essential workers we have in Zambia
I don't understand why some people find this funny! This is someone's life we talking about, not everything has to be political!
May God heal her 🙏🏽
Too bad , but why her the name is mentioned out of the patients who have Corona virus they were mentioning the years and the places where that particular person is coming from. Wishing her quick recovery.
I loved Dora when she was a journalist at Znbc,not so much as a politician.

I would watch news just cause it was Her, she sounded white,her English was amazing,i was very young.

As a politician she became mean and and somehow came out as uncaring.

It's sad that she is sick that is if she is.

When you become bad, people lose sympathy for you,see how many people are saying she is lying.

My only advice is that she must just Dance and rejoice with the other positive patients we saw.I mean what else is there to do.

Besides you guys never built any proper hospitals. If traveling was allowed, positive politicians would be flying out for medical attention,leaving the poor to die here in Zambia.

Guys let's catch a wake up, Zambia deserves more .The Gold is real.
She considered the situation as a fashion show but again why not Bow-man.
Where did she get it from, is contact tracing under way and where is she quarantined?
So there is no point in wearing a mask tefyo?? Coz she has always masked up. Get well soon iron lady.
Meaning those chitenge masks r ineffective....or the preacher is not practicing what she's preaching!
Why is it so special that she is everywhere that she has covid-19 the patients that have tested positive we don't even know their names
This is the first covid 19 positive case that has come with a name in zambia
Corona updates are not the same without Dora the explorer and uncle chichi.
Get well soon.
Covid in high profile offices shows how contagious the disease is. Get well soon madam Dora.
People can be evil, what wrong has she done to you? We can do better as human beings. Where is the love kanshi,?
Just hope its not one of dis games to make us believe covid 19 really exists in Zambia,, any way to bad .
So are we still testing the waters come 1st June? Asking on behalf of my neighbor
That,
THAT she may recover,
That every part of her being may gain total wellness.

That the sick at home, in towns, cities, villages may gain full restoration to their health,
THAT what is health may happen strongly to those who are weak and sadly sick threatened by the image of well being alone and with others,
That health may happen to all who need it's impact od influencing their bodies.
That every a people may have wellness in all ways when all is said and done in many many many many ways in all parts of the cities and towns
COVID-19 is unavoidable.
Whether you wear PPE to the fullest it will still find a way of getting into you.
Just like flu... it always finds a way of reaching you.

Let's all be in good health so that when we get infected we recover just like we do to flu..
She is just going for the dance ku isolation...by Monday she will be fine
I want to salute Hon Siliya for coming out and declare herself positive in public. It's not easy. We wish you well madam.
I have carefully listened to this video almost 5times. However, I have noticed something disturbing in the minister’s speech. There is a point where she says and I quote, “Yesterday I tested positive of Covid-19 and I have since informed ministry of health” end of quote.
My question is, How did she know she was positive, did she do the test herself and then inform the ministry or someone else beside the ministry of health did the test and informed the ministry of the results. I am confused 🤷‍♂️
I was made to believe that, it’s only the ministry of health that is doing the test and verify the results before informing the patient but in this situation it’s the patient informing the ministry? 🤔
But she always wore that big mask.
She can possibly have it.She used to touch her face mask when sensitizing about Covid on TV,that means she may have had been touching her parts that open doors for Covid too.Like we do to any other Covid patient,we wish her a fast & miraculous recovery.
Dora and Chilu have always been at high risk going by their continued exposure to the virus. She has added to the number, unfortunately.🙆🙆
Some people takes joy in ones misery, she may be anything but let's remember she's also human... Get well soon honerable D, siliya
Get well soon soldier against covid 19. May the Lord spare you and guarantee your healing for the good fight you are waging against our common enemy, the corona virus.
Lol this is comedy to me.. so the patient is here to inform us. Where are the other patients tho? And how special is your case If there are no symptoms?? I distance myself from this ka European stunt
Very much appreciated for her brave stance. The Covid 19 fight has been difficult with the so called VVIPs.
Together we can
And she has been telling us to mask up😷, maintain social distance, washing hands 👐 frequently and to not touch our face were did she get the virus I sense danger, so pa Monday ni more funds
Learn from her all y’all mingling like there’s no tomorrow, you could be asymptomatic without knowing it. Be safe and stay home. Most of you are waiting for death like feeling in order to stay home.
Atleast now you know some who is suffering from convid. The disease is real stop saying there is no covid 19 in Zambia. Stay safe stay home
Iyeee sad development. However she has to pull through. Moreover she is not the first one as a public figure to have tested positive.
Those guys just want to shika us better I don't see how true this is,ati pipo hv been quarantined but how come we've not been able see them but only her.because she's working with the government.we won't fall for this😂😂
I think actress Dora should visit mark angel comedy. They r looking for her in Nollywood
So she is been kept were?
I need to be tested too for COVID 19 so that we can be kept at the same place.
It's possible for her to get the infection. She's in the front line. Get well soon!
The good part is that Corona doesn't kill in my country. We are blessed.
Get welcome mama Dora
If it is true , new normal life style is in us. After hardworking, loudspeakers, TV etc. sensitizing, only to become good example of victim. This corona thing does not chose for sure.
Wat a brave and courageous minister,, indeed u hv BN busy in updating the nation...we wish u a speedly recovery so that u assume for national duty..it is well in Jesus name....great NOT...
We may not agree with Hon Dora in one way or the other but really having upto 2K haha reactions on someone who just tested positive with a deadly pandamic isn't really Zambian 🇿🇲.. We can do better people.
How about her running mate uncle cheetah-o-tela! If he is not then quarrantine him too as a contact! Coz the two have been inseparable during this covid and pliz remember that in zed males n females r supposed to b under the same roof same room!!!
Get well soon Hon Dora. The risk of Frontline staff is very high. Praying for your quick recovery.
She’s gonna be fine since in Zambia it’s different.
Its best to go public Dora should be commended for her actions like civilized societies do. De stigmatise it!!!!!
If they can't practice what the say everyday,why should we continue believing them?
There is just something not right about this.
If it's true ,am wishing you a quick recovery but if you are lying may you contract it seriously.
I've just noticed that even the spelling for positive is incorrectly spelt! Anyways be well honourable!
You people need to be serious !!! Not every thing is a laughing matter. Honorable Dora is not in good health like everyone who is ill with Covid 19 and you find it funny! 😠😠 How I wish this covid can visit you all who find think this is funny.. We need to hear your testimonies..
Is she that special to become national news? Other people have tested positive and have succumbed, yet their names haven't been subject matter. Ina any case, wishing her a quick recovery
This post has changed my life, meanwhile Jeremiah 29:11 in the byu byu!
She will be among the 300 to be discharged on Tuesday,.. Kaili ours is covid-19 lite
Someone said corona is also sexually transmissible. If you know you know. They have been so close since Corona came
Very soon we will see some more dancing in the isolation center.
Get well soon minister,is muliokela negative?
Too bad to hear that our hard working minister tested positive for covid 19 and now i understand that say which goes like(THE DISEASE MOSTLY KILLS THOSE WHO KNOW IT VERY WELL)
Please mwebantu. When you're giving us news, pay particular attention to your spellings. Mwilabilima ukubutukilafye posting your status. Edit your news with care. It shows professionalism and seriousness. It's POSITIVE not ifyo ulembele!
COVID19 in Zambia looks like nothing maybe am looking from a distance people are dying in some parts of the earth. Quarantine hospices in Zambia are extended disco houses I saw patients grooving in one facility.
Sad development.on a lighter note though she'll join bene tubatwalile covid 19 singers and dancers in isolation
She is going to be fine given an assurance by the President that our #Covid-19 is relatively different in zambia .
Politics aside this should not happen to anyone. Wishing her quick recovery.lts good she has come out to open.
Beans something fishy is about to happen if you know you know ! 🙂🙏
It's hard to believe ba PF nowadays, but if true, I wish quick recovery to her, God still has plans for her.
It is ok she will recover come Monday kaili Covid19 yamu Zambia yalipusanako neyaku Europe. Will only take this as breaking news if she does not recover next week.
It's possible because she's a human being also. But the question is, is it true she has tested positive?
At lest she is the first minister in Zambia to be infected with covid other ministers in Tanzania and other countries have already died. and we all know that covid in Zambia doesn't kill so relax my country men and women she will be fine along with others.
You have been in the frontline honorable, showing bravery and leadership. You will overcome.
Zambia loves you Mom and thank you for always be there fighting for us even in this critical time you never get rest.... Quick recovery Hon Siliya
Despite her promoting corruption and stealing of public resources which probably says allot about how one was raised I don't agree with making fun of her being suck. Keep in mind she is a mother and human being.every life matters...ai Grace Mwaba Nangwale?
She has tested positive for covid 19 she must be taken to where they take those tested positive not va self isolation kateka anakamba mailo ..
😂😂😂😂our government is funny wait the real corona strikes yr entire family then u will dance dununa revise.. u talk too much obviously it entered from your mouth madam corruption fighter
That's sad. Get better soonest and come out of quarantine.
What about bowman?
Do you pray for those in quarantine too already olo prayers are leaders only?🤔🤔🤔its a flue she will recover soon
Is it that serious, it's one of the jokes of the day. My hope is may be she can be an example of whose who are dying so that we take this corona seriously
This is the goodness of this pandemic it does not choose who to attack even the big fish, we wish her a very quick recovery
She is asymptomatic so she should not be released, nothing special just because niba Minister.
She just needs a share of that donated money,any way covid19 brings out secrets,soon ll see the pipo she was with
Well I have now believed that Zambians are LOVING people. I have read through three quarters of the comments, all are talking about LOVE Mrs Corona I wish you a quick recovery. I miss you on TV especially during the time of receiving covid 19 donations.
Get well soon madam, covid updates are not the same without you, especially when you start announcing the donations
So she is in a high cost isolation block.
People please don't show your foolishness like this. If a person teaches you to be careful about death it doesn't mean to say that person can't die.please let's get back to our senses and pray for our only Dora Siliya .you 'll step on it madam in Jesus name I pray Amen.
Get well soon, we want you to be looking when your boss hands over the instruments of power
Ba tamba imbwa imwe, why does the tone of the announcement sound like you are gleefully dancing around chinsali style?
Minister Dora quick recovery to you our frontliner
She should be isolated together with any ordinary people
Ours is special...don't worry she won't die..but she will join the dancing team
Wishing her quick recovery. I'm trying to think where she got it from!!! Most likely from those daily briefings. Have the journalists who cover the briefings been tested? There is need to lessen the numbers that attend the briefings.
Where was her beautiful mask and hand sanitizer?😂😂😂she will be fine
How come for this one the name is proudly published and the rest we have to rely on leaked WhatsApp videos? Yashani kanshi?
I don't know why some people are excited
Get well soon mama
Wat about our doves being sent out the grade 7,9,12 are they safe now that with or without safety measures you can get it,by the way wats the rush for Zambia?when many others are opening in August/September after the cold season.
What prompted her to test herself even while she was asymptomatic?
We may not see eye to eye politically but we earnestly wish her a quick recovery (if this news is true).
You don't have to politicize everything and anything. She's human she too can get sick
Corona doesn't choose ayi. Now most minister go abroad for treatment but in this case ni mulokofye.. And why has she been mentioned of all the people who have tested positive, it's not fair now. pipo will start discriminating against her. Get well madam!
If you want jokes watch Zuba🙄 and see how they accidentally tied the wrong Tando and didn't think I was going to notice, this is not funny, it shall be well our minister you will be fine.
Get well Dora. Just tracing her contacts will be rough coz they are a multitude . As in being a spokes person it's not easy.
She will recover and you ll never reach her level , , why celebrating an illness ?
Wishing her quick recovery. It's normal she is only human also. They are at higher risk. Us seated at home our job is to commit them unto the Lord as they work tirelessly to get rid of this burden corona.
Will my MP taken to Levy olo bwanji.. get well soon it's just a symbol of fighting spirit and hard work..
She has no covid19, she is just positive for the virus SARS COV2, the virus that causes covid19.
Why do I have a feeling that it's a planned move ai...any way 🤷🤷 life goes on
We done honourable Dora Siliya for coming out in the open, that's good leadership, unlike others who hide.. You shall be Healed in Jesus' Name.
The Zambian one is different from the other countries let her just start dancing if possible bankaleko 2 or more she will be discharged. Thts the cure ipola fast fast 😂 😂 eg the chinsali ones
Imwe,which front line staff...behind the camera ati front line.....when was she a nurse or doctor....lekeni ifi
Who are her contacts. They should come in the open too. Actually, she is the only known person in Zambia to be COVID positive
So sorry get well soon and thanks for coming out to share.
Just wondering why publishing her name? When all these cases names are kept confidential.
At least we now know one who has tested positive.
All along I never knew anyone who knew anyone who probably knows someone who knows maybe one who was tested positive.
And no1 should b flown out of the country to seek medical attention..ngati ni ma eggs na lemon they give to all covid patients mupaseni egg na lemon ndani.azapola
The good part of the covid 19 which we have here is different from the one our friends from western countries,them it was deadly but ours is friendly
In Zambia everything we must have an opinion! Dora Siliya is a human being just like all of us and no one is immune to the virus. Just wish her well or shut up.
Eish, too bad for her.
Doraz name has been aired what about others whose names were not been mentioned? Zambia our country....
Get well soon madam Dorah.
You will be fine in his name.
As long as she is human.. It's not strange 🤔
Didn't she just attend aerobics?
She was observing precautions everyday but how come she test positive? These are just politics
She has provided leadership according to my reasoning. ..some would have been hiding untill they have recovered. A quick recovery Madam Dora Siliya. ..COVID 19 is not a death sentence.
Dora Siliya has demonstrated leadership, that shows how active she is in fighting covid-19. Quickest recovery hon Siliya
Where is she right now?
impromptu announcement should be Monday's and Fridays where did she get it from those are details people need to know
After watching this post , I felt so motivated. It changed my whole life, now I'm a successfull person. I got 10 olympic gold medals, 6 Oscars, 7 reading awards. Next year I'm planning to buy moon. It's all happened because of you. Thank you so much 🙏🙏🙏😜😜
Get well soon madam but careful with her ,she will come back for u remember she as closed prime TV and she will say u have license and the gym trainer careful
If Dora is tested positive? How safe is Dr. Chilufya?
No wonder the daily updates have been banned by the president.Updates will only be on Mondays and Fridays to avoid human to human risk transmission on daily basis...... It's so sad.Get well soon Dora
I pray for a quick recovery ..may the Lord almighty God heal her in Jesus Christ name ..it is well honorable ..God will see you through ..let us continue to stay safe this virus is real ..taisala ..and let us stay home and be prayerful nothing is impossible with God ..all shall be well
So you saying she didn't take the preventive measures she was actually talking about.irony
Busy telling people to stay at home yet she was jumping up and down. Fyabupuba. And I hope she's not faking it so that they can enjoy more donations
She was on Camnet being interviewed by Pastor Chiluba and she was NOT in a mask????
How did you know? Was it a special update for her only? Coz they said only Mondays and Fridays to update us.
Too bad , Get well soon Dora! This reminds me of the whereabout of Chitalu Chilufya
I wish her quick recovery Covid 19 is not a respecter of any person whether you a front line or back line stay safe country people follow guide lines
Iyeee sad news may her soul rest peace in advance will miss her, iyeee Mwe Lesa I hope she contacted Italy and Wuhan covid19 first grade not this Zambian second grade covid19 we are hearing.
She is asymptomatic.... Question is what test kit was used to test her? Was it of the batch similar to that send to Tanzania which showed positive results regardless of the sample? Or was it a reliable test kit?
After wearing a suit from bottom to face the BOOM! she tets positive. Anyway get well soon mama
Too bad. At least she has announced her diagnosis. Others would have kept quiet. Some were getting angry at the mere speculation that they were in quarantine. Get well soon, my diva. You shall overcome 💪🏿💪🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Let the hand of death come on them suddenly, and let them go down living into the underworld; because evil is in their houses and in their hearts.(Psalm 55:15) Go and ague with God not Me👊👊
Kiki is she not the one who usually tells us to always mask up 😷
Fake....I don't trust her neither do I trust our Govt...mashododo and drama is their routine n order of the day let her die will believe Coco is real...As for now it's fufu veve in weldi....#bufi......
How did she get the virius? Plz can someone delight us. hopefully it's not politics
Wishing you our gallant soldier a quick recovery, you're a hero. The govt is with you.
After all the health guidelines that she was undertaking, still she tested positive.?Now what more will it be to those examination classes that they want to open? What assurance can we have to our children that they will be safe and won't contact the virus? Anyway, we know it's a gamic you're playing you guys.
Corona virus uya mu zambia taili saana it's just a flue probably on Monday sh will be discharged..quick recovery bamayo
I salute her for coming out. Some just disappear from public view.
Mmmmmm but this disease is funny. I think this disease targets much well up people Despite hygienic levels.
So even if you follow all measures if it's your to sick you can not saying that stay home wash hands it's that time so government should that open everything because they is no way some following all guide lines can sick
There was a cabinet meeting a few days ago... Test all of them.
All positives will be picked in an ambulance to a facility.
Get well hon. 💞💞
She s on record 920 patients in Zambia and a mong 577 covid-19 active and first minister to isolated
Atleast we have known one person now who has contracted the covid 19 kabili the rest we just hear numbers and gender. Get well soon honorable!!
But where is she kept or even other patients mwebantu? I really need to see the Mwe, Corona iliko?? Just 🤔 thinking 💭
Is she in pain or it just came out positive?
In fact just administer her to aspirin and paracetamol that's the cure
Am afraid teachers are going to be affected since they stand in front as well.
Maybe it was one reason he said once one tests positive they should self isolate
Dora Siliya is one hell of a woman alpusuka ,Mamma we may not agree politically but when it comes to health ,I care About you,Get well soon mamma you are one sharp lady...
If l be a patriotic Zambian, and human enough, l simply say sorry. Get well soonest and go back to serving the nation. It was not out of disobedience to laid down rules that she contracted the VIRUS but, because of being a front line worker.
But this sounds funny weee😅😅😅😅😅wait did you say she tested positive manje she couldn't take the precautions herself instead preaching there is time for everything to us,,Mayo Corona said"I have forgotten about you"pls adapt to the new normal.
Its fake and this makes my suspicions that this COVID 19 thing in Zambia its a hoax she's not a front liner staff she's nowhere near that if she tested positive then everyone at Ndeke house is positive including those at ministry of information meaning government complex should be fumigated
Guess thats why H.E directed coco updates twice a week,its making sense now,get well soon our media frontliner,the more reason journalists need to be protected,donate to journalists everywhere even in other provinces not just ku capital.
The situation is boiling, wishing Dora quick recuperation.
It's a scam, to prove that even ministers are catching the infection. I don't believe it, If shes doing it to attract donation she should be careful she will end up catching a real one
I wish her good health but why did she acted in that manner closing prime tv station
For covid-19.Don't laugh at your friend because almost every one affected,if not infected.who knows tomorrow u could be the next.
This is a true lie, she is just using defence mechanism to cover themselves from the pictures and videos which have been going round on social media showing quarantined covid 19 patients busy drumming up and dancing. Those pictures and videos clearly stated that the escalated number of covid 19 patients is just a mere propaganda. Dora plz don't play with covid 19, people are dying in other countries then you you're making funny of covid 19, wait God is going to give you his back and devil will take over so that he shows u really covid 19.
But she always wear a mask,kikikikiki what happened
This covid caucus must come to a close....let's quickly consider covid organics... however quick recovery..
Going to see her now, but did she ate shockers before testing? No ! Give her minutes she will be fine
It's my prayer that very soon yu will come back with a testmony yu are already healed in Jesus name
Yu will be well God shall prevail over this situation
If she dies that when will will know that corona is real.
After two weeks she will test negative ,let's wait and see zed for you
So should we wish her a quick recovery or the other message?
Thank you God, we now know that corona virus is real! Where is she admitted from
Yestde she was at a certain tv station we want serious tracing of contacts,plus no VIP isolation,this virus should bridge the Gap btwn vip & ordinary citizen we're all human beings,oooh loadshedding again power has gone
Finally Zambia has recorded a confirmed case and not these ghosts they have been tested and telling us about.
I hope this isnt just a ploy for the government to win public sympathy. And I strongly disagree with those saying she is a frontline staff, she helps the Health Minister in giving regular updates, but isnt that just about it?
That's COVID . no respector of titles.same oral and nasal pharyngeal Swab.I hope she has no Co-morbidity.
But she has been in a mask always 🏃🏃🏃
Iyi yeve ni beans, bayamba kutishinka butter manje. They just want to distract our minds from talking about the gold deal.
Somehow, I find this info to be untrue.
They know how Zambian minds are when it comes to paying attention to irrelevant issues.
All this while they have been preaching about confidentiality of covid19 patients, what has changed?
Am waiting to hear from Dora siliya herself, what type of medication is she on.
So ninshi ba chilufya bali na corona plus plus. 🤔🤔🤔
The good part is that the Corona Virus in Africa is different from the Corona Virus in Europe or Asia.
She will be ok,she only has flue.
Corona in Zambia does not kill.
Is it true,am not sure these guys are not worthy to be trusted, sorry to say this, but I just wander.
Dora Siliya tests positive for Covid-19 and you celebrate, when someone says that Satan is not your stepfather but your real father you begin to ask how they know. It's you am telling don't look at that one behind you.
Get well soon and now you see that masks are meaningless to covid 19 ka.... infact she was always in masks.
Mmmmmm kwashala Bowman lusambo and kampyongo once Bowman said that I will not rest until corona goes
Is it from the boy friend? Or from Covid19 money being donated??...
We are all human being and we are equal that is why you big people in authority you where suppose to build good hospitals yet your aim was to fly to out side Zambia for better treatment I hope even our madam Dora Siliya will go to south Africa for specialist doctors. Get way madam with local doctors.
How I wish one of the politicians could come out and say of HIV status. So that we can reduce the stigma. 🏃🏃🏃🏃
Ine m always left wondering what goes on in these peoples minds who react with 😂 sure sure palinavoseka apa aini awe kwena you are special.
Which is good yes them thy are paid for going put in public.
Wishing her a quick recovery! Am I the only one who heard our Republican President say that briefings will only be done on Mondays and Fridays? Just trying to think without the box.
I had seen this in the movie CONTAGION..the person who was infrontline got sick,watch it if you want...this is a movie,Dora will be okay soon.
Is this true.because it has been two days without report of covid 19
Was there an update today or did she announce herself?
I have a feeling that Doctor Chilufya and Lusambo are also positive
Its a scam to divert our attention away from the gold saga. Eyes on the ball ba people!
Am sure she has already ordered the Madagascan cure... Politicians
Where is she she going to dance too?
It's very normal and not something to joke over.Ala this disease is one of the few that ain't choosy no mater who Ur buleikata tabulesaala.
I knew it that one of them will follow Boris Johnson's foot steps. Elo balaikalapashi . Another positive person is going to follow behind I guess you all know the person am talking about. Believe me all of those busy chasing Coronavirus in the streets are the next to follow . Just hear the name covid-19 ati am stopping people to spread the virus kuti. Twakulaloleshefye anyway don't worry they will be fine because ma big buyers they have donors money lol. For us let's continue to stay home let them chase Coronavirus from the roads and streets.
If its true then naba minister of health he has coz these two are inseparable nowadays
But how come her name has been published? Get well soon hon minister
Let's practice what we preach ok ministers. Get well soon because Zambians need clarification on the story she said that every country has corruption and thiefs.
I don't believe it, its all a planned move. Something is up, covid patients in Zambia are given Chicken and rice maybe she just wants some.. Its like fufu veve fafa vovo in the weldi...
Aweh she can get sick the way the Madam loves moving up ad down as if she works fr sensus
Anyways get well soonest honourable you the reason why da number of corona is increasing
We pray for your quick recovery Honourable Dora Siliya, God is in control
How? after all the hype and going round the compounds doing sensitisation. They should also test pastor Chiluba from camnet, he was interviewing just yesterday.
The 'new normal' means this news should not surprise anyone
There is cure in Madagascar
That's what it is, Even during the early days of AIDS, those who sung a lot about it warning us are the ones who died of it.
Madam order the Madagascar herb asap for we still need as a frontliner staff
I now get the msg of asymptomatic patients self quarantining from their homes lol
If this can shock the masses,let's airlift her to South Africa to be Quarantined there.Is it not there they always rush to when they are sick,or is it just another of PF drama to push for more donors.I just awoke to to think it's April fool's day,alas kanshi ni ka leave ba pokele aka
Seven days,tayapwe no ku peas Ati IAM well.
Ask the USA or Italy how COVID 19 is like,you are even self announcing pa foolish ZNBC media Ati self quarantine at home,mama just rise up and get back ku office b4 that post is given to LUSAMBO.It is yesterday that ECL said from now on 'it will be a new normal',so e new normal' yenu ba Dora iyi..awe try something else!
Oh no, is ba Chilufya safe? Too bad , may she get well soon! I will really miss her pa mu la ba sa! This Corona is getting closer, hope it's not Donchi kubeba for the doubting Thomases! Get well soon !!!
What's so special about Dora suffering from covid-19
She has a boyfriend from Congo DR. Have you forgotten?
What about chitalu chilufya
But again i hope this isn't a stunt so as to make us think shani shani uko...
She has been masking up,washing hands/sanitising and practicing social distance...

Alwala shani????
Another wAy of requesting donations from abilodi?
She needs to die thats when we are going to belive that the covid we have in zambia is real
What I have seen about the civid-19 is that it moves in the air no matter how much you wear a mask. So she can catch up with that its new normal
Isn't she the one who used to tell people to stay home? How did she get it?
Is she symptomatic?
This beans is bad I have a stomachache, but my neighbor I love you take some & eat also
This shows that she is in front line
Mmmmmmm awe niboza anyway let’s count u will see the way she will recover fast than those already in #govt we know u now
Oh no not Dora, she's such a hard worker and catches every question making sure non are left unanswered
So we just settle for the fact that she is the only person we know with covid 19 ??i mean Idris elba being the only other back person with covid 19.
But how, next it will be Mr chitalu, I think it's high time the introduce Skype Covid update. They are capable of doing it with all those donations.
hmmm she is also a human being! this cannot surprise anyone
She's already fine this corona we have in Zambia is different, because patients in Zambia they even dance
Am switching my phone off, they can mistakenly include me in her recently contact
Personally am not suprised.. Get well soon Dora.. atleast you are a living testimony that those ridiculous measures you keep giving us aren’t working
I just wait to hear she is one of the discharged two weeks from now...
My question is why are they mentioning her name while all the covid 19 patients names are withheld?
She will recover esp that shiz asymptomatic but doc chilu should be quarantined also.
Stop playing with people's lives. Is this message official?
Drama Queen she wants to divert the attention from the Stelling of Gold to corona which is false.
She is being used as a sacrificial lamb🤔
Is she going to be admitted at chinsali dance hall?😎
Hope as Zambians we take this seriously...in the malls people are careless by taking masks off, refuse to sanitize their hands...maybe this will get you and me more serious about Corona
Being a minister does not make her immune to the disease. She's human. Quick recovery madam dora.
What's the total number of corona cases in Zambia now if we include her?. Zambian corona
Why did they mention her name what about the other patients in the weidi
She's as exposed as all the gallant people fighting Corona at the front end. Quick recovery and all the best, honourbale👏
Wishing her a quick recovery. Shame on all celebrating her illness even if you don’t like her.
A quick recovery Hon. Dora. Fi covid19 fingi pa zed such that people get sick and recover without even knowing they had it. Get well soon
Where are the contact persons? Covid is real. Its has no class.
I'm sure she will recover soon.
We pray for your quick recovery honourable, God will cover you under the shadow of his wings, in Jesus name Amen.
Corona virus doesn't move, people move the corona virus said Dora. Get well soon honourable
People dont know that you can have it but never show Symptoms and you will end up having anti bodies for it.
Is her immune so weak ???cauz this covd is attacking mostly elderly and people who got weak immune eg people with HIV. ..
Dora come to my house i will quarantine you nicely while chatting in nsenga n eating adapters(mbeba) for snacks you cant suffer alone come through baby gal
But mu Zambia pipo are very mwandini of all the things surely some one from nowhere instead of wishing madam siliti a quickest recovery only to pose a question what about Bar Man Lusambo... wish you a quick recovery
Seems Corona is missing Targets. .
We're waiting for other ministers to test positive as well, then will know who plays hasband to Dora kkkk
She has asthmaa not corona🙄🙄🙄 self isolation ninshi enenakwata umuti?
If health workers can test positive,how special z Dora?
Too bad for our dear hard working Dora. This is why the virus knows no boundaries.
Quarantine will give you some rest you've been hard working.. Don't worry in Covid is like a fufu veve and veve fufu 😉
Who tested her show and us the proof ?
She has no symptoms she just tested positive.
I wonder how a person can test positive without symptoms this is confusing, it's like you have flu without symptoms or malaria. The test kits are defective all the test are fake this is all rubbish we are not children tell this to you kids
Game over 😁😁😁😁 we can't be convinced people we know you to the fullest now, so that people see that even siliya is positive so Corona is real. Who knows maybe it's a secret Napita............. 🏃🏃🏃 🏃
She will be fine. Get well soonest Dora. Sending good thoughts and prayers your way
I heard say something like that when she came in the store yesterday getting some food stuff
was she exploring during this pandemic?
And she was in the cabinet meeting held on wednesday at Mulungushi Conference Center. I wonder who else she could have infected. !!!!!!
And people are busy saying, "there is No COVID-19 in Zambia". Let your immunity system prove them wrong. Get well soon.
She is been wearing the mask since covid 19 started today at iyo nabalwala am very much sure that this virus is for rich pipo not ,,,,,ine soche namugulu mu-town + ma broke without a mask but am still covid 19 negative .......lesa wamaka 🤟🤟🤟🤟
It's like some of here feel you can't get sick from Corona and you seem to be experts in mocking.
Karma is watching, you will also testify of Corona.
NON CONCERNED. HER'S FOR THE ASKING, IS SHE THE HEALTH PERSONNEL TO GET WORRIED?
But why of all people is her name only mentioned among all Zambian patients? Chino chalo ni animal farm zoona mwe. Anyway nimatenda for the rich. Qr Hon Siliya. 👏👏👏
Our Minister who use person car what of us who use public transport ,mmmm it's not things we are at risk, quick recovery my mum
This kind of foolish comments when somebody is sick are are not good and are un zambian, why should you be so unfair to the minister when she has been working so hard to help the public ? Some comments are not necessary and I REGUEST Hon Dora SILIYA TO IGNORE UN FAIR COMMENTS AND I WISH YOU QUICK RECORY IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST
It's a fufu veve fefe vovo imbobo in the weild
Wait what? She was at state house yesterday meaning........
Mmmm but mu Zambia out of of people Ababa positive you have never mentioned one by name it's only numbers but how came am now wondering if there is Corona in Zambia
It's nomalu she is human ,this corona has nothing to do with dirty which people talk about .
Ine I count it as one infected ,since shes the only one we know.. hope she ain't faking.. 😂😂 just becoz they said they shud stay home and self fimo fimo
Dora remember we were together yesterday so obviously naine am positive kuno
Worry less...... Corona virus is no longer a threat....... our Iron Lady will be back sooner than you know it.........I just hate to think that she will join those dancing inmates !!!!!!
She just want to go the isolation center to dance
Too bad. Everyone is potential to covid 19.therefore let's observe the health guideline....
Get well soon mama,God loves us all,remember someone's sweet is someone's poison, for me you are the best.
This means the whole crew Dora was found with during recent updates may have it and should all be tested and quarantined🤔🤔🤔
So she ll be quarantined with who? Someone was asking
I wish you well. You have indeed been very active and I love your charisma. Very energetic woman. Healing mercies.
And u also believe that she is covid19 positive,my pipo open yo minds and your eyes ...well played game
What of the ministrey of health?
But this issue of disclosing covid-19 patients has been a secret but how come for dora
So the new cases reported on Saturday brings the total from 920 to 921 cases.
Eeehh in the weldi..
She's scared of the missing monies hence keeping herself in quarantine.. Don't cheat us... Stealing in the weldi
Covid si sanka. Kulibe ati wavala matching mask.
Sorry mama get well soon just take it as normal flue and it shall be well..
Sometimes you may feel like they've faked it.. anyways get soon our able MP
What's deep down your heart?
That's bad,Get well soon Mama,I really loved her Energy during CoVID-19 updates.
I saw her with pastor Chiluba yesterday on TV, and they were not putting on masks. Chalo ichi.
Thank you tomorrow she will recover it's a normal covid-19 in Zambia
Don't worry Dora the Explorer, Zambian covid went to a private school.It doesn't kill
Of all the 900 cases we have ninshi ba lumbwila po fye ba dodo people am tempted to think this happens to be the first case Zambia has now mwebantu never panic even through the storm God is faithful
Is it true that Dora is sick or she's jocking , what about lungu? Look at him when is speaking , is he feat?
Where did they isolate her?
How come others are never mentioned by there names but only Dora Siliya. Strange
I thought its possible anyone can get, was she immunized against it?
Who mentioned her name, has far as we know we don't know anyone, so it's a joke unless you add other names also..
I don't believe that can u show her to us in the hospital?
She will be fine, kaili she is only tested POSTIVE and not POSITIVE for covid-19!
Corona has come for everyone no one is safe....
And i remember her going to eastern province some few days ago. And chipata has covid
I thought updates have only been restricted to Mondays and Fridays. Who is disregarding the presidential directive by giving updates on a Saturday ?
Maybe its false Dora she is very smart like my phone its just another way of telling the nation to observe the measures the government has put in place to combat the pandemic
You should also be mentioning the names of other patients that's wen some of us will believe that covid 19 is indeed here in Zambia other wise ......
Positive or not she will recover, ND fr as long as ts been found in the early stages
I pray that the real corona can come in zambia and show these pipo how it kills cz some zambian pipo are now playing with corona. I cant believe this at all am sure it's just a strategy for donors to pump in more money.
Let her die first that is when we can now believe that in Zambia covid 19 is there
why mention Dora other are not mentioned
That can't be news,is she not human like any of us? Please give us positive information don't always talk negative against our Leaders.
Political stunt as usual. One was beating people during the night! Roadblocks.. telling people to go back to solwezi. Another one Patrolling around Lusaka and eventually find a Chinese as his victim.
This is leadership, accepting and taking responsibility of what happens in one's life. God bless you Honorable.
I wish people would take Covid 19 seriously than making jokes about it. Zambians only take something serious when it affects them or someone close to them
This people are have trickys to show the outside that she is contacted with the disease she is even addressing the nation on TV news she just ok
En all this while I made myself believe ati there isn't corona in zambia 😂 gosh so this **** is real 🤦🤦 see my life
The first Zambian minister to be tested positive. Too bad, she will be ok.
Which one Zambian or Italian?
Saboi imboela wrote: Ok PF really knows politics. The opposition really need to wake up if they have to be on the same level with PF... Until independent tests are done I don't believe that the Chief Government Spokesperson has the coronavirus. These are high level, sophisticated, calculated politics... The funding from all over is really making our leaders to be more creative and daring. If hon Siliya is really positive to Covid-19 I will make a public apology the same way I have made this public post, otherwise to me these are just politics meant to get more money from donors.
So only those in higher offices are named will the other group are not? Warahell iz haffening?
with that cleanness Ba dora, where did you catch the virus. What of us who live in the shanty compound. Anyway get well soon.
That is why the President requested them to be making updates on Monday and Friday.
What is not connecting is this revelation, to what at some point was a secret when Chitalu Chilufya almost mentioned some senior Govt officials who were sick then but was stopped by the Vice President. Why now. Ine nakana.
Oh no Minister Dora, so sorry mama. Please don't worry you will fight it i know. My prayers go to u for a quick recovery. Am very sorry to hear this
Since she is asymptomatic is she joining the dancing group just asking
A proof that face mask, frequent hand wash, social distance, nafimbi nafimbi can't work and are useless.
Then you hear someone who does even listen to any News saying there's no COVID 19.
This is leadership the ability to admit Remember PF the time Micheal Sata was ill the entire leadership refused to admit that even when he went to address parliament. When he even failed to finish his address they claimed it was fashionable to do that. So to you my sister Dora when you have done is leadership to admit that you have TESTED positive.I wish you quick recovery so that you can return to your duties
Is she showing symptoms?if not discharge her
She was masking up, washing hands but stil she got corona, schools shud open jesu
May the Lord Jesus intervene. Be healed in the name of the Lord amen.
Point of correction pls dora was tested positive for covid 45 not 19.
Get well soon.we love you Dora...Let's pray for her coz shes done alot for this covid fight.
So will she be getting her allowance whilst in quarantine ai? Just asking
🤫
She mighty have gotten it from the microphone. Cos they don't mask it.
It's not covid19 but demons posed
were did she cotricted, is it from the front or back? Becz always she wearing mask.or sorry quick recoving ba honow
Someone is about to get allowances for contacting and healing from the coronavirus.. we have masterminded people spearheading the pandemic 😎
So it's so surprising? Nilesa? Even lungu can test positive
What a sad development and wishing her a speedy recovery. It is well your Honourable.
Oooh l have remembered, mwebantu plz check for that man, who moves in town with 7 hrs thing, we give him task to do the rearch on convid 21,oooh am sorry l mean convid 19! Again when u see some1 is murmuring when giving a speech, u know that convid 19 has struck him like north western lightening!
These are politics to influence people to start giving donations and to take this pandemic serious coz pipo have stopped taking it seriously (Covid 19) !.........It is just a scheme to woodwink the corporate world and individuals to make more donations. .......N wish u mama a quick recovery!
Those finding pleasure in this sad situation clearly shows that they are not a human breed but that of beast
are you sure with this news who has ever announced such in Zambia even malarial there hide and you want as to belive this please spear the pipo of Zambia we have better this to worry to this
Obviously if you are positive you allowed to export mukula everything with pf is money
This is politics,why going for self isolation instead of being humble and join the rest..
Don't worry DORA zambian colona is different to the one in europe you will be fine.
Does it mean a minister cannot get infected in Zambia unless in USA and Europe?those saying it’s politics you stay together?
That's the stigma Gov't is worried from some of the comments.Even Bally or Adada can contest it.Its just a flu remember.Her coming out is a reminder that we need to play safe.Mask up, social distance and abide by the new normal life
It's a new normal, there is nothing to warry.
Let her go to Italy for treatment, don't they always despise zambian hospital
Welcome to WHAT IF? What if this is just a .......... To make us believe, since we've been asking to see the patients.
The only way I'm going to believe that we have corona in Zambia is 'when she dies'🤭🤐😏
Health allowance there, more money in her handbags. I wish her the best.
Big question where did she get it from with all the protection she had mmmm
Covid is real let's put our trust in God coz that's the only source of help we have poleni bwangu mayo
Those are first priority officials, a medical team will be assigned to her during are self quarantine period...she will be back to her feet in no time.
Which isolation center
I don't know what to say to the medics who said that face masks protects us from covid 19..teti filondolole bwino, it's like a fufu vovo, its like a fafa veve in the weldi njojo.
Could this be the reason why Dr Chitalu Chilufya has not been coming to give the daily updates? Let everyone be quarantined for 1 month.
Which one..The symptomatic or asymptomatic?
Please don't update us again until she's de..... It's ok if that number becomes 8. Mr sata (mhsrip) suffered for that part and the person who was insulting him busy chopping the he suffered for... Ata!!!
They said they'll be giving updates on Monday and Friday.. Now who gave an update today Saturday?
We hope to see more donations now please Trade Kings an icon is positive we need more of your help than never before.
Iron lady wishing you a quick recovery.
It was expected as a front liner quick recovery
Mwebantu ,which Dollar is this ?Is it the Syrian Dollar ?Or the Dollar Slayer Or Dollar Yasila ,Which is which Mwebantu ?
No wonder I saw her driver walking and he was going to get public transport so how are those people going to be traced in that public transport just wondering..
That's when will know the truth if Coronavirus😷😷 is real in Zambia when will have 1 deaths from the cabinet members..👈
Let the whole cabinet be swabbed including our humble leader coz she was part of the cabinet meeting held on Wednesday 🤧
God heal our mother who is working very hard.it will be well in jesus name.
Those of you who were saying you don't know anyone who has tasted positive to covid 19, there you know now.
Wow!!! I don’t wish anyone in Zambia to suffer from this illness. Get well soon!
The lord who is healing others will heal her
Get well soon dora, politics aside, health comes first
We all know just how much covid-19 news has lost relevance lately, hence this......🧠
I'm ready to compose a dancehall song featuring JK for the isolation room she'll be in 🤷‍♂️
She doesn't look like a covid 19 patient she looks strong may she recover quickly in Jesus name amen !!
Did she travel to Pakistan too?
mmmmm positive futi? so strange I find it so hard to believe.
Sacrificial lamb... Ndipo she's loyal.
She will recover. Every one recovers from corona unless otherwise
She is fine kaili corona yapa zed its different nabene borrise.
The president orders everyone testes positive but asymptomatic can go on self isolation boom Dora tests positive without symptoms kikikikiki fun is our corona such a joker?
So how many cases of Covid 19 including Dora?
corona virus you're evil, why choosing Dora Siliya instead of going back to China whr you came from.
How come ? she always masked and maintained social distance....On top of that Sanitized !!! Maybe the test kit worked wonders
Better n d good I love this woman,may God be wth yu mama,not thse other ministers thy are always in hiding when people talks about them
When I look at how people in other countries are dying and I look at my country Zambia. God only you know what is happening and we only look to You because we do not know who or what to believe anymore.
God is faithful and He needs to test our Faith in Him.... Let's pray for her recovery
Because of what the people of zambia have gone through under the current administration,even real things have already been received with mixed feelings.
It may be really or not but we have been tested to believe that anything comes out of PF Government is never true.
That's when the donated money will work😅😅😅
It's very possible,she moves around alot.so sad😭 wishing her a quick fade
The result of rubbing shoulders with the Indian community and Chinese.
I wish her a quick recovery, she has been doing a great job in the fight against covid 19. I hope trust she is going to recover by the grace of the Almighty God.
Ukwenda too much the more reason why she is always putting her self in the line of fire... The good part is abantu balepola Covid19
Sorry hon Dora by the way where is receiving treatment from?No body is immuned to covid 19 .get well soon.
I am sure I am not the only one who thinks this is a scam.... 🤦🏿‍♂️.... Like TBH, I'd bet anything this mama is fine... But anyways I am sure we are all positive after all😈.... How much money have we gotten from donations that could possibly build a huge hospital to house people who are sick like Dora Siliya🤦🏿‍♂️... There will come a time, ten or 15 years from now when all the people who got richer from Covid-19 finds will be held accountable....
I thought it was said they don't disclose who is infected with the virus..
Sorry but she can be taken to chinsali there COVID 19 dancers she won't feel boring
I can’t believe this is true. Doing it for numbers?
With all her matching masks how did she get it?
Why should you laugh about Dora being sick of corona ? What's funny ? what kind of Christian's are we ?
When I just saw the humility when handling opposition in the northern part of Zambia i knew something is wrong somewhere. Get well soon honourable.
This Virus is a Deadly Demon but l wonder why Christians have gone to sleep
Corona is corona no one is above corona (only the creator)... Otherwise it's a sad development.
Tell me the ward she will be Quarantine I also want to b Quarantined there please....
Where’s seer 1 ail ?
So she couldn't want for Monday to update us?
Now that people are challenging you to show them any victim of covid19,you think saying Miss Siliya's stunt will work.
Mind control. Government elite team wants to make COVID-19 appear very real contrary to popular opinion. We know the game you guys are playing. We ain't kids anymore.
"Its good for someone to die, to save millions.
Those are fighters can't die from covid 19.
meaning in the last 24hrs they have recorded 1 case olo bwanji?
It is well with you May you find strength in God alone.
So far she is the only patient I know in Zambia. Get well soon
Paipa panoanje,let those she had contact with in her joint briefings be tested too to avoid the spread of the disease
If this is real then corona in Zambia is also real
Don't believe anything PF will tell you, there is more to this... what about health minister after that ACC warn and caution
So she will be quarantined aini? I wish it was the same with Monica the owner of Monique's school in Rhodes park along bwinjinfumu.....
Get well soon Madam Minister but we still want Prime TV opened,The Post Newspaper. We are all God's children your healing is there.
Dora siliya is always found with a lot of people e.g chilufya chitalu the minister and the press...they should get sick too.
We wish her a very quick recovery in Jesus name
Hope she will set an example of dying,then I shall believe that covid 19 is real in Zambia
Put her in isolation forever.
Lol why are u so surprised is she not a human being?
She is human not so?
Wishing you quick recovery madam.You good works will surely speak and cry for your quick healing.
Wishing her and all the other patients a very quick recovery
She just had a flow not corona virus
I thought the minister of health said they shall not disclose patients names. It’s supposed to be confidential but ehh 🙄🙄
How about ba chichi coz there’s no way she can be in this alone
Even Prime minister's in uk got hit so who is dolar to be spared. Good part Zambia COVID is 2020, if it was 2019 type sembe anso twasila fast but COVID 20 ni mbichana mbichana
I just hope this is not a just a plan and if it is then let the real Corona catch up with you and if not..... U can join the dancers in the isolation centre as well.........
No one will die of corona virus in zambia
Its normal anyone can fall sick at sometime
She'll be okay.. it's just flu
She can't die the corona we have doesn't kill
This will back consultations of not opening bars
Too bad! Dr Chitalu Chilufya has stopped putting on a face mask during their briefings and the two ministers sit in close proximity are my suspicions about him also been a potential carrier of Covid 19 wrong?
she's too much talkative nowander why the corona has find a way to enter into her dirty mouth kaili...
My iron lady.
Quick recovery to her and the many still not well.
Blessings.
It's very sad moment but we pray for her for quickly recovery in Jesus name
Corona z friendly in Zambia, she will get back on her 2feets in no time. Wait n see..
Get well soon.
Quarantine all z colleagues including balya ngikwite and sad news at a same time 😢
And the total acumulative number comes to hw many in last 24hrs
As if it's an airborne disease, the covid-19 killing Americans is it the same Corona in Zambia behaving like malaria?
And then we met her in pick n' pay on Wednesday...Does it mean we are booked for quarantine 😢😢😢🤔🤨
Do masks even work?now am worried us who have twa chitenge😟 but she will be discharged in 2days this is zambia
She was sitting too close with the Minister that's why. Ichalo chi
And then someone think there is no covid 19 in Zambia. Quick recovery siliya
Do they want us to believe that there is covid #20?
Another top government officials should test positive for Covid-19.
I mean look at other countries.
They just want to make up stores 😡😡
let's hope contact tracing won't bring out more issues mwebantu
Wishing her quick recovery,she is a hard working lady.
Where is Chitalu Chilufya?
I'm paying for her healing. Wishing her the quickest recovery.
It is well with her soul. She will be healed in Jesus name.
On this one I have decided not to comment nalema mwe so Dora naye ni actress let her be ku levy quarantined then we can discuss this.
Too bad its not a things for one to joke or happy. Am just passing through
It's a fufu veve in the weldi..anyone can have it
Ninshi everyone in Zambia is asymptomatic?
what about DR. CHITALU CHILUFYA , Is he in quarantine too? I haven't seen him of late.
Get well soon Dora siliya. You have really worked. God bless you our mother.
Wish her quick recovery, she is come out so strong and organized in disseminating Covid-19 information. She is just human. Get well soon dear minister 🥰
Where did she get it please????
She is really a hard working minister and wishing her a quick recovery in Jesus name
Wishing her a quick recovery and all those in isolation centers
Hmm! Sure? I wish her quick recovery.
Good that she has come out in the open early.contact tracing should start.wishing her a speedy recovery 🙏🙏

God is with us to you who take this seriously let me tell u . You'll have it if you want it ... to me this is an error nd it has been planned to make u blind that u continue suffering while tham the can get enough of money's.. you will see she will get recover nd thank you that you helped her with your prayers .

God will see her through, get well soon mum and our prayers are with you.
Lovely show,as we dance to the tune together
Thoughts and Prayer to you Honorable Siliya.

Get well soonest and return to do your Amazing job.
This is the first case of Corona virus I guess, a big question mark on these other figures.
7.6k likes and 3k comments can someone get healed like this lol....
But how come shes the one sick and not the Doctor Chilufya??
This means that all ministers should be quarantined coz of cabinet meetings.God protect our country
I wonder how much she has been paid..anyone with half a brain can see through this lie.
So aba bamambala they are telling us ama social distancing and nafima face masks but bena they dont do that, if they do then How did she get it if I may ask?
Lets hope the money budgeted for covid fight isnt stollen or else walakwatamo touch,you will feel how it is to be a zambian
What we can do now is to hope for the best. Wishing you a quick recovery!
Faith Mwansa.....Sarah Lubinda come we wish aunt Dodo a quick recovery
If true, May th Almighty God grant her healing aswell as all those infected.Get well soon Anuty Dora.
The best part of covid 19 is there is nothing like going abroad 4 specialist treatment .Get well soon honorable ,we cherish you .
But why why! She's always put on a mask from 06 :00 hours to 20:00 hours.
Well quick recovery and bravo for being the first government offcial to publicly accept the status
Still thinking otherwise what if this is a scam .......
Wanting people to believe that she is the first patient we are seen.... ok my hand writing in The weldi 🤔🤔🤔
At now any sicknesses is covid every sickness died long time ago #corona one sickeness with two names
May the hand of Jehovah rapha touch her
Our $$$ we are very sorry,wishing you a fast regaining from depreciating.
It shall be well with her! Wishing her a very quick recovery.
It shall be well.

As we heard yesterday from our blessed presided his excellence Mr Edgar Lungu..

" Jeremiah 29 vs 11 , for I know the plans I have for u declared the Lord, plans to give u hope and not to harm u...

Blessed are those who trust in the Lord.

She has been so hard working towards others hence God can't just forget her.

She will be well in God we trust.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Quick recovery Hon may God heal you together with all those who are ill
What about bowman?
Get well soon Honourable we are with you in prayers our Jehovah God is always able mama.
It shall be well mama I pray for a quick recovery
We thank God for answering our prayers. Quick recovery Dora.
Guys there is a difference between a driver and a conductor? In our case,health personnel are drivers,MPs, Ministers are conductors going round the bus to insure passengers are in sit belts. If Dora is a front liner ninshi we are all front liners
Is she a celebrity?
So Dora has been the first patient to know who has corona virus,
Because it's her you announce. Others we don't know them
Quick recovery, madam siliya, may the hand of the Lord touch you with healing mercies.
She ll be fine...wishing her a quick recovery...
So yesterday only 1 case, out of how many tests?
Zambian Corona, that one, it doesn't kill.
She'll be fine in no time.
Well calculated.since other top officials in other countries have contracted covid19 it's just right that we also record one. .Zambia for you 😅😅
The entire cabinet is her contact
There is one minister who has been silent recently could it be the same case?am not talking about Bobo 😁 😁
Let's hope there won't be anything like day of prayer and fasting for our leaders 🙄🙄
I doubt the truth in this,but who knows maybe it's true or maybe not?
Dr.Chitalu Chilufya is also a suspected COVID patient. Is it wrong to assume looking at the spread?
I ask the Almighty God to touch her with the healing hands so that she quickly recover in Jesus name
Those same press briefings... I don’t get it, why people can’t just address people in their homes.
But but you said updates will only done on Monday and Friday?????
Mbuya wandi mama Hon Dora Siliya quick recovery mama you are a hard worker mama
Is she not being used as an example to some of us who doubt the existence of covid in Zambia? Kaya mwe, I still have to see a clear example not this one. And and I don't know Dora, to me she's just muntu wa pa Tv..
They should also test chilufya chitalu coz ka social distance tapaleba during the announcements of corona updates
Isn't she supposed to go to the Covid centre?
Are there benefits to one tested positive for covid-19? Just asking.
Okay though the Covid-19 we have in zambia does not kill. But I think if Covid-19 was sexually transmitted she would not tell us🙅🙅🙅
But how did she get the virus she was always masked up and followed the guidelines....... while people in City market and Soweto ain't masking up but ka covid 19 free so meaning that mayo tamfumwa ukutemwa ukuwendaanda mulika bus telling people about covid 19 have you ever seen adada going around streets 😂😂😂😂🏃like you
May she get well soon but am shocked at the number of cold hearted people who are happy about her sickness 💔...... You even have the audacity to say thank God she is sick...... Like are you normal??? God doesn't work like that.
I was wondering why in Zambia its only common pipo who where having the virus while in other nations it's pipo who have higher positions nomba twalingana
By next week she will be alright....wishing her quick recovery.....i mean in Zambia it's different from Prime Minister Boris.....they should also take that partner they seat with.
Dance in peace mama we miss you 😈
Please mr grim ripper do your thing
They have started mind games... wait and see
Now the Covid in Zed pipo show no symptoms🤔
Get well soon madam Siliya. We all know u are front liners in this pandemic we pray u get well soon and continue your work.
She will surely get well,we serve a merciful God who forgives and forget,Dora get well soon
If Dora siliya can be tested positive ninshi bonse tulibalwele ba covid 19 shamonako ubulwele bwashupa infi
ivi so ma donor bazatipasa ndalama zoona. Good work pf 😂
Too bad. Wishing her a quick recovery in Christ Jesus.
Did Dora attend any Cabinet meeting in the last 10 days?
Your thought could be as good as mine when it comes to "contacts."
Everyone has their own opinion on different issues so lets not be nasty to others. We can agree to disagree and thats maturity plus fair play.
Honorable, wishing you a quick recovery. Zambia needs your services.
Too bad she might have contracted the virus from the donations they have been receiving.
Dora siliya is a human weh ..so it's normal to get infected actually its a sign that she is a hardworker..
Like seriously???? But why are these fake prophets telling us that there is no #Covid in Zambia. I hate these men of Gold, they are so useless.
she is just human too quickly recovery Hard working Right Honourable Minister
It's a scam if you don't know... In Zambia no 1 has died of covid-19..
The God I worship.. The God of Bishop dzozi will heal her in jesus name. NO premature death..
Our beloved sister get well soonest you are a champion
Travelling around the world and associating with people, media and so own, wat do u expect, get well soon Dora siliya..
What has Zambia turned into??? Chess, snakes and ladders or ludo or may GTA
May all the remaining sick persons including her be discharged in Jesus might name🙏🙏🙏🙏
The health minister is more vulnerable to covid19 than Hon Dora could it be his disappearance is now explained 🤔?
It's normal right?
Was she kissing a patient boyfriend?
Am I the only one who thinks it's a publicity stunt
Nanga ba hn Chitalu kaili penzelibe S/distance
No donations ati ba minister tested positive to covid_19, corona yamu Zambia tefintu mapepo
They just need more donations to be pumped in.
Mama polenenifye naimwe u promised to bring am masks ku woodlands still waiting or myb tukesefye kung'ada kumyenu direct?
Get well soon my lovely Hon Dora may the all might father be with you are the piller of the country.
My Iron Lady get well soon. I would love to meet you mwe. Woman of influence😍
They do not run for from anything
They stand and for what is right.
So God bless the women now.
Wishing you a quickest recovery Mama
Get well soon honourable and may God be with you and your family.
Tell her to reopen our Prime tv station,,,and she will be ok,,,before it's too last term go packing,,,,,,2021 is my BAIIY.
Bufi it's just to alarm the nation to make us believe corona in Zambia is real bonza iyo
Wishing her quick recovery brave move as an example to everyone
Maybe some people will take it serious now see that it's real? madam Dora may God be with you, we care, much love for your mama❤❤❤get well soon
can't wait for the end of covid stories.and i would appreciate if the GVT can just put back everything in shape.before hunger kill people.otherwise talema
Now this covid19 is becoming more of political(Government seeking attention) believe you me,why should they list her,when 100 of corona pt, were not mentioned inclusive Medical personnels ,Government yesu kuwayawaya fye!!!
Wishing her a quick recovery. She is only human
sorry ba Dora but I have never seen u attending any event without proper PPE so covid-19 is jst time sorry recover soon
In GOD we trust 🛐
Just give her 14 /21 she will be fit .
Were is she nw?
She is human just like any other,she isnt prone to sickness
Can they announce if its true?
Doctors and nurses are getting sick and die so what of dora or me??God's healing power over us all🙏🙏 quick recovery to her..
Tabafwa. PLEASE PASTOR MOSES CHILUBA OF CAMNET should do Self QUARANTINE we love him too. Our Diva DORA DORA Don't worry tayipaya. We are praying for you.
Wishing you a quick recovery, you're a hero mama for being in the front line ♥️
She is a strong woman and she will get better soon.
Probably a publicity stunt to attract more donations & a plea for debt cancellation , but this will just create a fake picture that Zambia is a covid 19 hot spot . However this action will hurt the ordinary citizen more e.g like most Chinese plants not allowing the workers to go home & other companies still closed. The aim now is flattening the curve coz this disease is slowly taking away food from the common man's hands . Selfish leaders who have time & time failed this country .
Maybe more money will come in if a politician gets sick.
Ukutemwa ama allowance konse you are there know how to deligate at times. Wish her quick recovery anyway
Wre did she get it from?
Can she open prime tv?
Mmm People mu isolation will be intertainted by the minister..awe those people are enjoying mwe..
I have strange feelings towards this🤔🤔
How can she be negative when she uses Chinese face masks which are reportedly the corona carriers
The way others r celebrating and making fun of this situation awe napapa Wat's so good about someone being sick
We wish the Hon Minister a God’s hand of health and quick recovery
Ok apa to be honest we don't know the truth pantu Covid 19 tebulwele bwakunyelako nomba pa Z tulebunya
Were is the video we prove??
The good news is that our own covid19 is friendly, my lady will surely be fine, in God we trust.
Quick recovery to you mama, and all the affected ones.
Nothing strange she is human
i expected Zambians to say there is no corona virus here it is just a campaign tool for pf
lam wishing Madame quickly recovery and those who are in the same situation, may our good Lord remember you people
Am sure its nothing naimwee its just the useless Chinese testing kits they're using Indian government issured a warning against using any anything coming from chine doing these uncertain times..especially testing kits face masks etc..
Did the guys have a cabinet meeting this week guess they need to contact trace
Our corona is very safe she will be well after 14 days
Am here for Comments please be straight and mind yowa spellings
Does this mean the identity of the people with coronavirus will be reviewed? Or Siliya is used as a bet for donations?
It's miracles to announce her.
Zambian politics 😝😝😝. So that all those who were doubting Zambia's Covid-19 can believe we have it here🤔🤔. Wait a minute, did she announce that or it was Chitalu Chilufya??? All in all, get better soon mama...
Wishing her a quick recovery.all those in the forefront are at high risk.
Just another scam. Remember we need more donations to come in. 2021 is around the corner.
that's leadership, it's because she is working. wish her a quick recovery.
Just saw the video she says she's positive but fine
Wishing her a quick recovery, she has been on the frontline from the very beginning.

With all those preventive measures she follows
Do we even have it for real in zed?😯😯😯
First of all Why did Dora Siliya used to insult Sata?

Wishing her a quick recovery... Hoping to see her after 14 days out of quarantine...
Wishing her and everyone a quickest recovery
God be with you Honourable. It is well. God is with all.
Why did she even do the test?
I have now believed there is corona in Zambia

The is the way of blackmailing us..😃😃We won't fall for that.. This is not London🤣🤣
You ll be fine mama.
My question is that y mentioning her name when others we don't know them
She will ever be given allowance for that
Nothing serious she will be fine coroner virus yamu Zambia tefintu
I'm here to represent the comments reading association(CRA)
And then mailo no new cases we've already included her tomorrow

When she was in mask all the time
At least she's being transparent

So that those who don't believe can believe and take this covid19 serious
So this covid 19 it's up to individuals to announce publicly that they are positive. Sad development nomba kanshi yabipa.
Am sure she meant a foreign boy friend

So there will be an allowance!
And she attended a cabinet meeting
That's her story, we are busy apa na nkani ya sample price ya gold mine, let her postpone her sickness to a later date, tiliko busy apa mwandi
Sad; contact tracing should come into play
Too mant unnecessary movements. Show off is ever bad.

This is the real meaning of the Zambian provebs which goes like
The leader must lead by example
Politics aside I wish you a quick recovery 🙏💛
So what are we supposed to to say napapa
It is well with her
This is real bad, i mean, you can't tell me madam Dora Siliya has NOT been in physical contact with Dr Chitalu Chilufya, Steven Kampyongo and many other ministers, who have been in physical contact with the president in the last 14 days

It was gonna be better if the entire Cabinet was isolated

anyway since we have people recovering, bazapola nabeve...😷
It's like a vuvu vovo it's like a vava veve in the weldi njojo nbobo
I just feel good the way they pronounce front liner, get well our front liner
She'll be fine in no time 💪
But is saw her putting on three(3) masks😂😂😂😂,but corona baby saseka
Mmmmmm it's a new normal
Let the contact tracing start now
I want to see if this covid kills
I like that song by the dope boys ati "iyo ni beans"
Too bad,i thought it will be like dora siliya tests positive for uhule.
Shz a liar another actress acting for covid19 money after removing makeup ati I tested positive give us a break please
You forgot to mention she is in high spirit
No wonder I stopped seeing her sitting next to Dr chitalu
Give her 10 liters of Madagascar organic shit
Some people will never be trusted even if they are telling the truth. Anyway get well soon.
And parly opens soon.
If her recovery is not successful (God forbid), then people will begin to realise that COVID-19 is real...
She has joined the dancers
Hope it's not a new plan
Dora the explorer, let her explo the #covid_19.

Hi everyone, watch my new YouTube video about the Zambian Minister Dora Siliya who has tested positive for covid19 and watch how people have taken the news.

https://youtu.be/p4ignOQSMks
Kwasila ninsh its the entire cabinet manje
Let her die she is an Obstacle to Zambian people
Scape goat 🐐
It's normal it's not a sexual disease and she is not the first. wish her quick recovery
Ba ant-corruption commission ba ngenemo.
I don't trust these people.

a month ago someone said this and I quote.
"May any official trying to steal Covid 19 donations, catch the real covid 19." I hope sanabe
Nomba 13 minutes 1 thousand comments? Did this come with comments already?
Can the donated money be shared already imweh you guys while she's in quarantine??
😏😏😏Women are difficult when it comes to money
It's called MONEY HEIST 😔
Its good she just tested positive and after two weeks she will start living her normal life,it was going to be bad if she was with symptoms of coronavirus.So she has now become an example for whatever will happen after she gets better that's what wil be happening to every person who be testing positive for covid 19
I love corona virus for 1 thing, lack of discrimination..get well soon dora
